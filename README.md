# Ada Subtype Constraint Error Example

This example demonstrates a potential runtime error in Ada programs involving subtype constraints.  The code attempts to increment a variable beyond the bounds of its defined subtype, leading to a `Constraint_Error` exception at runtime.

The solution shows how to prevent this error using range checks or alternative approaches.
